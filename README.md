# The Hobbit, or There and Back Again

⚠️ **Work in Progress** - everything may change at any time. The main goal is to create the most interesting and realistic textual game possible.

An interactive text-based RPG game based on J.R.R. Tolkien's works, where you control Bilbo Baggins in his journey through Middle-earth. The game uses Claude AI to generate dynamic narratives and character reactions.

🎭 **Living Character System**: Bilbo has his own personality, emotions, plans, and thoughts that evolve based on your actions. Your decisions shape his character development, while his current state influences how he perceives and reacts to the world around him, just like in real life!

### Key Technologies

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + TypeScript
- **AI Integration**: Claude API (Anthropic) with cache_control optimization
- **Internationalization**: react-i18next
- **Vector Database**: LanceDB with multilingual embedding model (Xenova/multilingual-e5-small)
- **Build Tools**: Vite, PostCSS

## ⚙️ Configuration

The `game.json` file contains minimal essential settings:

```json
{
  "api": {
    "anthropic": {
      "apiKey": "your-claude-api-key-here",
      "baseUrl": "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages",
      "model": "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219"
    },
    "embedding": "Xenova/multilingual-e5-small"
    }
  }
```

**New in v0.3.0**: Configurable embedding model with better multilingual support for improved memory search.

All language settings are handled by react-i18next configuration.

## 🌍 Adding New Languages

1. Create folder `public/locales/{language_code}/`
2. Copy translation files from existing language (ru/en/es)
3. Translate all content: `common.json`, `rules.json`, `state.json`, `rules.md`, `prompt.md`
4. Add language to `src/i18n/index.ts` supportedLngs array
5. Add option to language switcher in `src/App.tsx`

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**"game.json not found"**
- Make sure you copied `game.json.example` to `game.json`

**"API key not configured"**
- Check that your Claude API key is properly set in `game.json`
- Ensure you have sufficient credits in your Anthropic account

**Translation errors**
- Verify all files in `public/locales/` have valid JSON syntax
- Make sure all language folders have all required files (common.json, rules.json, state.json, rules.md, prompt.md)

**Save incompatibility issues**
- Save files may be incompatible between different game versions
- If you experience errors when loading saves, clear browser cookies
- Start a new game if save loading continues to fail

**Claude API issues**
- Game includes ai_thinking field that shows Claude's reasoning process
- If you experience issues, check `log.txt` file for AI reasoning and raw responses  
- The ai_thinking field helps understand how Claude makes decisions
